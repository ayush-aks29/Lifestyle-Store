# Lifestyle-Store
Create a folder named images in the directory where you will store all of your codes and paste all the images in that folder.

In this project, I have used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap for making the website responsive.
This is just a front end website and your login or signup credentials on this project won't be validated at backend.
